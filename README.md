# DHS/CISA Secure Software Development Self Attestation Form

This repository contains a [markdown version](self-attestation.md) of the draft Secure Software Development Self Attestation Form.

It also contains a [table](references.md) of the references at the top of the PDF.

Links are clickable wherever possible to make it easier to reference specific sections of the document.

## Purpose

I found myself struggling to copy/paste/modify the PDF version as I read it and prepared my comments.
I figured that converting to markdown will make it easier to read and reference in other tools.

I also decided to share this in case anyone else is doing the same thing.
Remember, comments are due by June 26th!

## Original Version

The PDF version of [this draft is available on cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/secure-software-attestation-form).
It was released as part of a [Request For Comments](https://www.cisa.gov/secure-software-attestation-form) on April 27th.

## Differences

The only intended differences are related to markdown formatting (ordered list delimters, etc.).
Feel free to send PRs if anything else is missed!

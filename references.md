please review the chart below.

| Attestation Requirements | Related EO 14028 Subsection | Related SSDF Practices and Tasks |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 1) The software was developed and built in secure environments. Those environments were secured by the following actions, at a minimum: | 4e(i) | [See rows below]| 
| a) Separating and protecting each environment involved in developing and building software; | 4e(i)(A) | PO.5.1 |
| b) Regularly logging, monitoring, and auditing trust relationships used for authorization and access: i) to any software development and build environments; and ii) among components within each environment | 4e(i)(B) | PO.5.1 |
| c) Enforcing multi-factor authentication and conditional access across the environments relevant to developing and building software in a manner that minimizes security risk; | 4e(i)(C) | PO.5.1, PO.5.2 |
| d) Taking consistent and reasonable steps to document, as well as minimize use or inclusion of software products that create undue risk, within the environments used to develop and build software; | 4e(i)(D) | PO.5.1 |
| e) Encrypting sensitive data, such as credentials, to the extent practicable and based on risk; | 4e(i)(E) | PO.5.2
| f) Implementing defensive cyber security practices, including continuous monitoring of operations and alerts and, as necessary, responding to suspected and confirmed cyber incidents; | 4e(i)(F) | PO.3.2, PO.3.3, PO.5.1, PO.5.2
| 2) The software producer has made a good-faith effort to maintain trusted source code supply chains by:
| a) Employing automated tools or comparable processes; and b) Establishing a process that includes reasonable steps to address the security of third-party components and manage related vulnerabilities; | 4e(iii) | PO 1.1, PO.3.1, PO.3.2, PO.5.1, PO.5.2, PS.1.1, PS.2.1, PS.3.1, PW.4.1, PW.4.4, PW 7.1, PW 8.1, RV 1.1 |
| The software producer maintains provenance data for internal and third-party code incorporated into the software; | 4e(vi) | PO.1.3, PO.3.2, PO.5.1, PO.5.2, PS.3.1, PS.3.2, PW.4.1, PW.4.4, RV.1.1, RV.1.2 |
| The software producer employed automated tools or comparable processes that check for security vulnerabilities. In addition: a) The software producer ensured these processes operate on an ongoing basis and, at a minimum, prior to product, version, or update releases and b) The software producer has a policy or process to address discovered security vulnerabilities prior to product release; and c) The software producer operates a vulnerability disclosure program and accepts, reviews, and addresses disclosed software vulnerabilities in a timely fashion. | 4e(iv) | PO.4.1, PO.4.2, PS.1.1, PW.2.1, PW.4.4, PW.5.1, PW.6.1, PW.6.2, PW.7.1, PW.7.2, PW.8.2, PW.9.1, PW.9.2.

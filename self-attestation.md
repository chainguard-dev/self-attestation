## Attestation and Signature
On behalf of the above-specified company, I attest that [software producer] presently makes consistent use of the following practices, drawn from the secure software development
framework (SSDF), in developing the software identified in Section I:

1. The software is developed and built in secure environments. Those environments are secured by the following actions, at a minimum:
    1. Separating and protecting each environment involved in developing and building Software;
    1. Regularly logging, monitoring, and auditing trust relationships used for authorization and access:
        1. to any software development and build environments; and
        1. among components within each environment;
    1. Enforcing multi-factor authentication and conditional access across the environments relevant to developing and building software in a manner that minimized security risk;
    1. Taking consistent and reasonable steps to document as well as minimize use or inclusion of software products that create undue risk within the environments used to develop and build software;
    1. Encrypting sensitive data, such as credentials, to the extent practicable and based on risk;
    1. Implementing defensive cyber security practices, including continuous monitoring of operations and alerts and, as necessary, responding to suspected and confirmed cyber incidents;
1. The software producer has made a good-faith effort to maintain trusted source code supply chains by:
    1. Employing automated tools or comparable processes; and 
    1. Establishing a process that includes reasonable steps to address the security of third-party components and manage related vulnerabilities;
1. The software producer employs automated tools or comparable processes in a good-faith effort to maintain trusted source code supply chains;
1. The software producer maintains provenance data for internal and third-party code incorporated into the software;
1. The software producer employs automated tools or comparable processes that check for security vulnerabilities. In addition:
    1. The software producer ensures these processes operate on an ongoing basis and, at a minimum, prior to product, version, or update releases; and
    1. The software producer has a policy or process to address discovered security vulnerabilities prior to product release; and
    1. The software producer operates a vulnerability disclosure program and accepts, reviews, and addresses disclosed software vulnerabilities in a timely fashion.
